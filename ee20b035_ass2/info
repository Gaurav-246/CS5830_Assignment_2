dag2.py                 :  This is the DAG file
beam_pipeline.py        :  This is the beam pipeline for analyzing the data

The rest of the python files stored in the 'plugins' are helper functions, they are called 
in the DAG and Beam files. Please store them together for ease of access.

Specify the directories you want to store the zip files and gifs accordingly
in the DAG and Beam python files, they should be visible easily.

There are also some sample gifs generated by this program in the folder 'sample_GIFS'.

NOTE : There are many missing values in many of the months, as well as many of the columns.
       If they are missing, the average was computed with the remaining values, if not they are kept as nan.
       This is why some of the GIFs created have some missing points in some months, because those months' data was not available.
